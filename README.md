# Project Title
Easyshop Application
## Description of the Project

EasyShop is a simple Java user-friendly shopping cart application that allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, update quantities, and manage purchases with ease. The app ensures that each user's shopping cart is safely saved and stays the same even if they log out or close the app, so they can keep shopping without losing their cart.
